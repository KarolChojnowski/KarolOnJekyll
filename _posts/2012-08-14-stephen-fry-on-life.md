Open Culture has just posted a [brilliant interview with Stephen Fry](http://www.openculture.com/2012/08/what_i_wish_i_knew_when_i_was_18_stephen_fry.html) (recorded in April 2010).Â Some really insightful thoughts there on social media, mentoring, kindness, critical thinking, learning, technology and life.
