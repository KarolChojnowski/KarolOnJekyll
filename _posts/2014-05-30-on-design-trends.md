Quoting from Rams' [principles for good design](https://www.vitsoe.com/gb/about/good-design):

> **Good design is long-lasting**. It avoids being fashionable and therefore never appears antiquated. Unlike fashionable design, it lasts many years – even in today’s throwaway society.

One way to render your designs obsolete is to follow current 'design trends'. Keeping up with the fashion it's not a badge of honour, it's a red alert.
