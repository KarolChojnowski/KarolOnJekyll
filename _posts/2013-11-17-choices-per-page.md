Really good blog post by Kathy Sierra about how [poor user experiences deplete our cognitive resources](http://seriouspony.com/blog/2013/7/24/your-app-makes-me-fat).

And not just while they're deciding... even after we choose, an unconscious cognitive background thread is slowly consuming/leaking resources, "Was that the right choice?" [...]

> If our work drains a user’s cognitive resources, what does he lose? What else could he have done with those scarce, precious, easily-depleted resources? Maybe he’s trying to stick with that diet. Or practice guitar. Or play with his kids.

Great reminder that our designs echo beyond our applications.
