Jason Fried [writing for Inc.](http://www.inc.com/magazine/201404/jason-fried/do-not-overdesign-your-website.html):

> But when I look at what's hot in Web design these days, I'm turned off. It's all a bit too slick, a little overdesigned. I'm sick of slick.

> Most of these designs can be described like this: First, you see a huge photo with some text over it. Then, as you scroll down, the background slides away and another big photo with more text on it pops up. And so on.... Maybe you've seen this style--it's starting to crop up everywhere. To a designer's eye, it looks good, and it's technically impressive, but I'm not sure it says anything meaningful about the companies using it. Worse (for those companies), it's created a new kind of clutter: Too many companies look the same--all style and not enough substance.
