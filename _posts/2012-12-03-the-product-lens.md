[Chris Dixon](http://cdixon.org/2012/12/02/the-product-lens/) on balance between product development and financing:

> Good entrepreneurs spend most of their time focusing on the other market: the one between their company and their customers. This means looking at the world through the lens of products and not financing. This lens is particularly important when you are initially developing your idea or when you are thinking about product expansions.

> The product lens suggests you should ask questions like: have the products in area X caught up to the best practices of the industry? Are they reaching their potential? Are they exciting? Are there big cultural/technological/economic changes happening that allow dramatically better products to be created?

As a rule of thumb - companies that don't view things through the product lens are short lived.
