When working on a product it's sometimes hard to justify the last 10%. When everything's in place and all the things work as expected, in theory you could launch. But you have this nagging feeling that your product lacks that last layer of polish. 

What do you do? [Joshua Porter explains](http://bokardo.com/principles-of-product-design/): 

> The difference between a good and great product is the last 10%. Everyone has the same 90... the same core features and similar pricing and a similar story. But that last 10% is the real differentiator. It is the part that separates you from your competitors. It's the blood, sweat, and tears of detail. And it might take 50% of your time. But time is not what you're measuring... you're measuring the difference between good and great.
