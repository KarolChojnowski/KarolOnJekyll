Clayton Christensen on disruptive innovation ([from Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disruptive_innovation)):

> 1. Established companies are usually aware of the innovations, but their business environment does not allow them to pursue them when they first arise, because they are not profitable enough. [â€¦] Firm's existing value networks place insufficient value on the disruptive innovation.

> 2. Meanwhile, start-up firms inhabit different value networks, at least until the day that their disruptive innovation is able to invade the older value network.

> 3. At that time, the established firm in that network can at best only fend off the market share attack with a me-too entry, for which *survival* is the only reward.

Does this sound like RIM, Microsoft, Dell or HP to you?
