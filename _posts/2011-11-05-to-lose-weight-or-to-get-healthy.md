If you define your problem as "we need more page impressions", you most definitely put your focus in the wrong place. When that happens, short cut techniques that might actually hurt you suddenly become viable and what's worse, are easily justified.

Thing is, if you turn your efforts into getting healthy, the weight problem will no longer be an issue. By getting healthy I mean fixing user experience, if you haven't guessed.
