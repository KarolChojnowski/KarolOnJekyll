MG Siegler lays out [good arguments](http://parislemon.com/post/74254860109/content-content-content): 

> Where’s the future of television we’ve been promised every year for the past decade? It always seems to be coming “next year”. And I have a hunch that 2014 may be [no different](http://parislemon.com/post/74233023454/intels-box-could-have-been-tivo).

> Here’s the thing: there isn’t actually a technology problem in this space. That is, while the current solutions offered by the cable providers mainly suck, they suck because they can suck. Big Cable is holding all the cards. And they know it.
