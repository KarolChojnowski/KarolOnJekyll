Greg McKeown, writing for Harvard Business Review, in his article [*The Disciplined Pursuit of Less*](http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2012/08/the_disciplined_pursuit_of_less.html):

> Why don't *successful* people and organizations automatically become *very* successful? One important explanation is due to what I call "the clarity paradox," which can be summed up in four predictable phases:

> - Phase 1: When we *really* have clarity of purpose, it leads to success. 
> - Phase 2: When we have success, it leads to more options and opportunities. 
> - Phase 3: When we have increased options and opportunities, it leads to diffused efforts. 
> - Phase 4: Diffused efforts undermine the very clarity that led to our success in the first place.

> Curiously, and overstating the point in order to make it, *success is a catalyst for failure*.

And Horace Dediu, in his recent article [*Think Small*](http://www.asymco.com/2012/08/22/think-small/):

> Understanding the “fundamentals” of a product is far more important than having lots of products for the sake of diversification alone.

> The *fundamentals* of a product are knowing its job to be done and thus its requirements which, when well executed, will position it precisely and unambiguously on an opportunity.
