A while ago I read Tonny Maning's brilliant _[Making Sense of Strategy](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0814471560/)_, and some of his insights came back to me last night when talking about the importance of having a continuous strategic conversation within an organisation. 

Without further ado, Tonny Manning on planning:

> Many companies treat strategic planning as an annual rain dance, but wonderful plans don’t necessarily bring rain. Usually, they turn to dust.

On having a "fingertip feel" for what’s going on inside your business:

> Meaningful strategic conversation requires rigorous probing into what your organization does, why, and how. But that doesn’t mean it’s exclusively a matter for top managers. The fact that they hog it in so many companies is precisely why it so often comes to nothing.

On the importance of frequent communication:

> Choices, commitment, and capacity are not the products of machines. All result from people talking to each other. All come from that everyday activity – conversation – that we mostly take for granted and often use carelessly because it’s such an integral part of our lives.

> If you’re not engaged in a constant conversation about what lies ahead, what it means, and what you should do about it, the world will pass you by.

But here is the key quote:

> When people don’t talk about the right things – and don’t talk about them constantly, creatively, and constructively – things quickly come unglued. Parts of the organization come adrift and resources are sprayed in different directions. On the other hand, when people are informed, involved, and encouraged to speak their minds, miracles happen. Synthesis is most likely when people meet and talk face to face. So you should do everything possible to make this happen – and to make it easy.
