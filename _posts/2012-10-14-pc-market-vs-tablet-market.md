Interesting [comments from Horace Dediu](http://www.asymco.com/2012/10/11/why-are-tablets-and-smartphones-insulated-from-tough-economic-conditions/) on the decline of the PC industry and the phenomenal growth of the tablet market.

Dediu questions various analysts, who despite the fact that the buying conditions are exactly the same for both PCs and tablets, notoriously blame the economy, the rate of innovation or some other challenges that apparently dampen the PC sales. 

Horace Dediu explains:

> My hypothesis is that the new products are solving new jobs for the users and those new solutions are trumping any “softness” in demand. In other words, an upgrade to an over-serving product will be deferred at the slightest excuse while an installation of an under-serving product that attacks an unsolved problem will be rationalized no matter the circumstances.

> One product will be met with “Why should we buy it?” and the other by “Why shouldn’t we buy it?”
