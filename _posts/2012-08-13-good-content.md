Few thoughts on what makes good content:

1. **Good content is honest**. It doesn't pretend to be anything more or less than it really is.
2. **Good content is supported**. No content should be ever published without a maintenance plan.
3. **Good content doesn't waste words**. Every paragraph, sentence or word should work hard for it's living.
4. **Good content cares about what readers think about themselves**. Don't focus on how smart you are, but help your readers become smarter instead.
5. **Good content is well presented**. It lets your readers know that you care.

This list is work in progress - let me know if you think I missed something out.
