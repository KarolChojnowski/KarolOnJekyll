LinkedIn has just published an interesting study of the [economic trends of various industries](http://blog.linkedin.com/2012/03/08/economic-report/) spanning across the last five years.

What's interesting about this report and [this picture](http://blog.linkedin.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/industry_growth.png) in particular, is that the two sectors at both ends of the scale (Newspapers, and Online Publishing) are in fact in the same business, yet Online Publishing is blooming (+24.3% growth) and the Newspaper sector is shrinking badly (-28.4%).
