> Back in the day, news people made choice by deciding which stories to write. Today, we have to adopt a similar rigor about what we choose to share and amplify. In sharing (on Twitter or even re-blogging) we are sending the same message as doing an original news report. The easy thing is to share or reblog everything, but by being deliberate about it, we are essentially “editing” and telling the world: “this is how I see the world/this particular beat.”

I agree. If you want to become the lens through which your readers grasp and understand the world &mdash; apart from painting pictures with your own words &mdash; your job is to curate and share what the others have said.

The aim is to be the first port of call. Not last.

Automated non-curated feeds make you neither first or last (or influential).
