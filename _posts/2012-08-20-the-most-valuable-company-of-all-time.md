Jonathan Ive (senior VP of industrial design at Apple), 2 months ago:

> We are really pleased with our revenues but our goal isn't to make money. It sounds a little flippant, but it's the truth. Our goal and what makes us excited is to make great products. If we are successful people will like them and if we are operationally competent, we will make money.

Pretty humble for [the most valuable company of all time](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-19325913).
