Ryan Woodward on animation:

> The Illusion of Life. This is where it’s at. […] 

> If the movement doesn't help the viewer to believe that this character or object has life, then by definition, it's not animation. That is the distinction between motion graphics and animation. Animation is hard to accomplish.

Bonus: briliant short 2-d animation by Ryan Woodward - [*Thought of You*](http://vimeo.com/14803194).
