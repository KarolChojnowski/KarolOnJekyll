Hamish McKenzie, writing for PandoDaily, has some [interesting thoughts on tablet-only magazines](http://pandodaily.com/2012/08/13/magazines-dont-have-a-digital-problem-they-have-a-bundling-problem/):

> Lest you think this is just a paper problem, keep a close eye on what’s happening with tablet-only magazines. If publishers thought tablets were going to be the saviors of their industry, they must be really bummed out by recent news that The Daily is cutting a third of its staff and the Huffington Post has decided to stop charging for its iPad magazine after just five issues. Working on the principle that three events equal a trend and two pass for a story, AdWeek last week asked “Are Tablet-Only Publications Dead?”.

But I really like McKenzie's conclusion:

> But the game isn't over for journalists and editors – it’ll just be leaner and different. They will have to produce content that can move easily outside the borders of pages and apps, content that can be shared – even purchased – at the click of a button, content that can live on the strength of its reporting and writing.
