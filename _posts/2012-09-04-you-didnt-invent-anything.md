I like to think making things is more than simply [mixing ingredients](http://www.mondaynote.com/2012/09/02/apple-never-invented-anything/).

Otherwise, journalism is just words on a page, art is nothing more than paints and brushes, cooking is simply putting vegetables and meat in a pot, management just making decisions and design just shapes and materials.
